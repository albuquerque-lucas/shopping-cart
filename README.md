# Shopping Cart

üõí **Project Overview - What's it about?**

Welcome to the Shopping Cart project! This is a web application where users can make requests to the Mercado Livre shopping API. Users can interact with the page by searching for products and adding them to their shopping cart. The cart dynamically updates with the total value, and all the data is saved in the local storage with each interaction.


This application was developed as part of a programming course at Trybe. Many individuals worked on this project, and this is my personal contribution, adding my own touch and implementing concepts of object-oriented programming. My differentiating factor was the use of object-oriented concepts, grouping the required functionalities into service and controller classes.

## Technologies Used

üöÄ The Shopping Cart project is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript:** The primary language used to develop the application, enabling dynamic and interactive functionality.
- **Fetch API:** A modern JavaScript API for making asynchronous network requests to fetch data from the Mercado Livre API.
- **Local Storage:** The browser's storage mechanism used to persist cart data between sessions, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.

## Installation

‚öôÔ∏è To run the Shopping Cart locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/albuquerque-lucas/shopping-cart.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd shopping-cart`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Features

üí° The Shopping Cart project offers the following features:

- **Product Search:** Users can search for products in the Mercado Livre API and view the search results.
- **Add to Cart:** Users can add products to their shopping cart, which dynamically updates the total value.
- **Remove from Cart:** Users can remove products from the cart, which also updates the total value.
- **Persistent Cart:** The cart data is stored in the local storage, allowing users to resume their shopping from where they left off.

That's it! If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out.
